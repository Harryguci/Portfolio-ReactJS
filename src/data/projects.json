To address the complexity of overseeing project processes, documents, plans, and capital, we introduce a specialized Investment Project Management Web Platform.\n\nThis robust digital solution provides a centralized system for comprehensive project oversight. Its key innovation lies in the integration of OCR and Large Language Models (LLM). This advanced technology automatically processes and extracts critical data from various project documents—such as contracts and financial reports—ensuring that all project information is captured, categorized, and managed with exceptional efficiency and accuracy.\n\nThe platform drastically reduces manual administrative effort and significantly enhances the effectiveness and transparency of capital management, driving informed decision-making for Tay Ninh's economic initiatives.",

Built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL + pgvector, and multimodal AI capabilities.\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n• **Database-First Architecture** - Zero in-memory embeddings, all vectors stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector. Achieves ~99% memory reduction (~2MB per 10k chunks vs ~45MB traditional RAG) with unlimited scalability limited only by disk space.\n• **Advanced Retrieval** - Recency-weighted search with 15% boost for recent documents, dual embedding strategy (Text 384-dim + Multimodal Vintern 768-dim), and hybrid search with keyword fallback for robustness.\n• **Multimodal Capabilities** - High-speed PDF processing with PyMuPDF, image OCR using Gemini Vision API, and visual content search enabled by Vintern embeddings.\n• **Production-Ready** - Async initialization with concurrent model loading (30-40% faster startup), graceful degradation for optional components, Google OAuth authentication with JWT tokens, and modern React + Ant Design frontend.\n\nThe system uses Gemini 2.* Flash Lite for fast, cost-effective answer generation and performs O(log n) similarity search with indexed pgvector queries. Typical query response time is 1.5-4s with cold start in 4-6s.",
